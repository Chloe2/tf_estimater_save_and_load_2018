# tf_estimater_save_and_load
A toy example of how to save tf estimater and reload it for more prediction.

Main purpose:
1. save, load, and predict is an important function any data scientist shall know how to do.
2. after searching for a while, I didn't find much straight forward example about how to do it with tf
    -main diff I found was that, tf has many diff levels and thus seems confusing to many beginners
3. this notebook mainly aim to explore how to do it with a simple & easy toy model.


Notes:
...notice that, for tf, feature's column names can't contain space or ()
